## Why This Theme Exists

I noticed that all other editors like intellij, zed have really nice color schemes. I tried to find a good one for vscode and I couldn't.
Theme theme is fork of [Zed One Dark](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ARRRRNY.zed-one-theme). I changed several colors to make it closer to original Zed colors. But the biggest difference is support for jsx syntax.
