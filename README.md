## Why This Theme Exists

Many popular editors like IntelliJ and Zed come with beautifully crafted default color themes. However, I struggled to find a dark theme for VS Code that matched such quality.

This theme is a fork of [Zed One Dark](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ARRRRNY.zed-one-theme), which is inspired by the default dark theme of the Zed editor. My version focuses on enhancing React JSX syntax highlighting and adjusts several colors to align more closely with the original Zed theme. While it doesn't replicate the Zed theme entirely—due to inherent differences between VS Code and Zed—I hope it brings a visually pleasing alternative for VS Code users.

### Installation

To install this theme:

1. Open the Extensions view in VS Code (`Ctrl + Shift + X` or `Cmd + Shift + X` on macOS).
2. Search for `Zed Editor Dark Theme`.
3. Click `Install` to install the theme.
4. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl + Shift + P` or `Cmd + Shift + P` on macOS) and type `Color Theme`, then select `Zed Editor Dark Theme`.
